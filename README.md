# Port-Simulation
This is a simulation of a cargo port system, which manages the movement of ships and cargo around the port. It focuses on the implementation of core model classes that represent quays, ships, cargo, and movements of ships and cargo in and out of the port. The simulation is written in Java 11, uses JavaFX 11 and can be run on IntelliJ IDEA.
