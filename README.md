# Cargo Port System Simulation

## Introduction

This simulation is a representation of a cargo port system, which manages the movement of ships and cargo around the port. The goal of the project is to demonstrate a strong foundation in object-oriented programming by implementing the core model classes.

## Features

* Represents quays, ships, cargo and movements of ships and cargo
* Keeps track of all cargo that enters and exits the port
* Stores the direction of movement, time, and cargo/ship being moved

## Installation
* Java 11 and JavaFX 11 must be installed on the machine.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run it.
