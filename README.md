# Cargo Port System Simulation

## Introduction

This is a simulation of a cargo port system, which manages the movement of ships and cargo around the port. It focuses on the implementation of core model classes that represent quays, ships, cargo, and movements of ships and cargo in and out of the port. The simulation is written in Java 11, uses JavaFX 11 and can be run on IntelliJ IDEA.

## Features

* Represents quays, ships, cargo and movements of ships and cargo
* Keeps track of all cargo that enters and exits the port
* Stores the direction of movement, time, and cargo/ship being moved

## Installation
* Java 11 and JavaFX 11 must be installed on the machine.
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run it.
